<p>For all his success with Barcelona, Messi has come under fire for his inability to help Argentina's national team win a major title. He did lead "La 
Albiceleste" to the final of the 2014 World Cup, and was named player of the tournament, although his team lost to Germany. In 2016, following Argentina's 
second consecutive loss to Chile in the final of the Copa America tournament, Messi announced he was ending his run with the national team.

Recognizably smaller than most of the kids in his age group, Messi was eventually diagnosed by doctors as suffering from a hormone deficiency that restricted 
his growth. Messi's parents, Jorge and Ceclia, decided on a regimen of nightly growth-hormone injections for their son, though it soon proved impossible to pay 
several hundred dollars per month for the medication. So, at the age of 13, when Messi was offered the chance to train at soccer powerhouse FC Barcelona's youth 
academy, La Masia, and have his medical bills covered by the team, Messi's family picked up and moved across the Atlantic to make a new home in Spain. Although 
he was often homesick in his new country, Messi moved quickly through the junior system ranks.
